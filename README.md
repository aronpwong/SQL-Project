# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The purpose and goal of this project is to showcase my ability to transfrom and analyze data in SQL.  

## Process
1. Download the .csv files and upload them into PostGreSQL 
2. Determine the data type for each column and the primary key for each table
3. Build an ERD (Entity Relationship Database) and Schema
4. Clean the data and remove any unneccessary data
5. Create queries to transform the data
6. Validate your SQL statement
7. Optimize your SQL statement
8. Develop a Quality Assurance (QA) Process

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
Everything is a challenged when you work full-time and overwhelmed by the amount of data available 

## Future Goals
*Stop getting anxious and take it step by step
*Asking for help more often and not being shy
